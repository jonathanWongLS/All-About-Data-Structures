# Graph
### A. What It Is?
    It is a node with edges that connect nodes together! Linked list, trees and prefix trees can be considered as graphs as well. 
    
    A general graph can have NO restrictions where the edge can have any direction the programmer intends. This can make it a little complicated.

    We can represent a graph with an adjacency list which has two columns:
    - Node
    - Neighbors

    Every single node has a list of neighbors in the form of an array.

### B. Tell me more!
    Since there can be many different algorithms that can be used with graphs, we will have varying time complexities and they will depend on the algorithm itself.

### C. What are the time complexities in Big-O notation? 
    Varies!
